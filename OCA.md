Java 1.8 OCA Exam Preparation
This repository contains resources, code examples, and tutorials to help you prepare for the Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) Java SE 8 Programmer Certification Exam. The goal of this project is to provide practical examples and clear instructions to solidify your understanding of Java fundamentals, which are essential for passing the exam.

Project Structure
The project is organized into different Java files and directories, each focusing on a specific topic covered in the OCA exam syllabus. These topics include:

Java Basics: Variables, data types, and operators.
Control Flow: Conditional statements, loops, and switch-case constructs.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Packages: Proper organization of Java classes and how to use fully qualified names.
Exception Handling: Try-catch blocks, exceptions, and error handling.
Java APIs: Commonly used classes and methods from the Java standard library.
Running the Code
To run the Java tutorial programs from the command line, follow these steps:

Navigate to the directory containing your Java source files.

bash
cd /path/to/your/source/files
Compile the Java files. Use the following command to compile all .java files in the directory:

bash
javac *.java
Navigate to the root directory of your package structure. For example:

bash
cd /path/to/your/root/directory
Run the Java programs using their fully qualified names. Example:

bash
java com.package.name.ClassName
For more details on running and compiling Java programs, refer to the helpme.md file in this repository.

Simulation Code Examples for OCA Exam Topics
1. Java Basics: Variables and Data Types
Java
package com.udemy.oca;

public class VariablesDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10; // Integer data type
        double price = 19.99; // Floating-point data type
        char grade = 'A'; // Character data type
        boolean isPassed = true; // Boolean data type

        System.out.println("Number: " + number);
        System.out.println("Price: " + price);
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
        System.out.println("Passed: " + isPassed);
    }
}
2. Control Flow: Loops and Conditional Statements
Java
package com.udemy.oca;

public class LoopsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // For loop example
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("For Loop Iteration: " + i);
        }

        // While loop example
        int count = 1;
        while (count <= 5) {
            System.out.println("While Loop Count: " + count);
            count++;
        }

        // If-else statement example
        int score = 85;
        if (score >= 90) {
            System.out.println("Grade: A");
        } else if (score >= 80) {
            System.out.println("Grade: B");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Grade: C");
        }
    }
}
3. Object-Oriented Programming: Classes and Methods
Java
package com.udemy.oca;

class Student {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Constructor
    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Method
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
}

public class OOPDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student = new Student("John Doe", 20);
        student.displayInfo(); // Call the method to display student info
    }
}
4. Exception Handling
Java
package com.udemy.oca;

public class ExceptionHandlingDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw an ArithmeticException
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Execution completed.");
        }
    }
}
5. Packages and Classpath
Java
// File: com/udemy/oca/PackageDemo.java
package com.udemy.oca;

public class PackageDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This is a demo of using packages in Java.");
    }
}
To run this program:

Compile it by navigating to the root directory and using:
bash
javac -d . com/udemy/oca/PackageDemo.java
Run the compiled class using:
bash
java com.udemy.oca.PackageDemo
6. Common Java APIs: Strings and Arrays
Java
package com.udemy.oca;

public class StringAndArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // String example
        String greeting = "Hello, World!";
        System.out.println("Length of greeting: " + greeting.length());

        // Array example
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        for (int num : numbers) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
