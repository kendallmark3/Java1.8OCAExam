# Java Coding Conventions and Best Practices

This document outlines the coding conventions and best practices we expect you to follow in your Java projects. Adhering to these guidelines will lead to more readable, maintainable, and consistent code.

## 1. File Organization

* **One Public Class Per File:** Generally, each `.java` file should contain one `public` class or interface. If a class is tightly coupled with a `public` class, it can be placed in the same file but should not be `public`.
* **Package Structure:** Organize your classes into logical packages. Package names should be all lowercase and follow the reverse domain name convention (e.g., `com.yourcompany.project`).
* **Import Statements:**
    * Place `import` statements at the beginning of the file, after the `package` declaration.
    * Organize imports: first standard Java libraries (`java.*`), then third-party libraries, then your project's packages.
    * Avoid wildcard imports (`import java.util.*;`) as they can make it harder to see which classes are being used. Import specific classes instead (e.g., `import java.util.List;`).

## 2. Naming Conventions

Follow these standard naming conventions for clarity:

* **Classes and Interfaces:** Use PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase). The first letter of each word is capitalized (e.g., `MyClass`, `UserService`, `Runnable`).
* **Methods:** Use camelCase. The first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of subsequent words is capitalized (e.g., `calculateTotal()`, `getUserById()`, `processOrder()`).
* **Variables:** Use camelCase (e.g., `userName`, `itemCount`, `totalAmount`). Choose descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the variable.
    * **Constants:** Use all uppercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`). Use the `static final` modifiers for constants.
* **Packages:** Use all lowercase (e.g., `com.example.util`, `org.apache.commons.lang3`).

## 3. Code Formatting

Consistent formatting improves readability.

* **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces for indentation. Avoid tabs as they can be interpreted differently by different editors.
* **Line Length:** Keep lines to a reasonable length (e.g., around 80-120 characters) to avoid horizontal scrolling.
* **Braces:** Use the "Allman" style (also known as next-line brace style) where the opening brace `{` is on the line following the declaration, and the closing brace `}` is on its own line, aligned with the start of the declaration.
    ```java
    if (condition)
    {
        // code block
    }
    else
    {
        // another code block
    }
    ```
* **Spacing:**
    * Use a single space around binary operators (e.g., `a + b`, `x == y`).
    * No space between a method name and the opening parenthesis (e.g., `calculateTotal()`).
    * A space after commas in argument lists (e.g., `method(arg1, arg2)`).

## 4. Comments

Comments are crucial for explaining your code.

* **Javadoc:** Use Javadoc comments (`/** ... */`) for public classes, interfaces, methods, and fields to document their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions they might throw.
* **Inline Comments:** Use `//` for short, explanatory comments within a method's implementation. Use them sparingly to clarify complex logic, not to restate obvious code.

## 5. General Best Practices

* **Keep Methods Short:** Aim for methods that perform a single, well-defined task. Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain.
* **Avoid Magic Numbers:** Use named constants instead of literal values directly in your code. This improves readability and makes it easier to change values.
* **Handle Exceptions Properly:** Use `try-catch` blocks to handle potential exceptions. Avoid catching generic `Exception` unless absolutely necessary; catch specific exception types. Either handle the exception or re-throw it with a meaningful message.
* **Write Unit Tests:** Write tests to ensure the correctness of your code. Frameworks like JUnit are commonly used for this.
* **Be Mindful of Immutability:** Favor immutable objects when appropriate, as they can simplify reasoning about your code and improve thread safety.
* **Follow the Principle of Least Astonishment:** Write code that behaves in a way that is predictable and not surprising to someone reading it.

## Example

```java
package com.example.myapp.service;

import java.util.List;
import com.example.myapp.model.User;
import com.example.myapp.repository.UserRepository;

/**
 * Provides services for managing users.
 */
public class UserService {

    private static final int MAX_USERS = 100;
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    /**
     * Constructs a new UserService with the given UserRepository.
     *
     * @param userRepository The repository for accessing user data.
     */
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    /**
     * Retrieves a user by their unique identifier.
     *
     * @param userId The ID of the user to retrieve.
     * @return The User object if found, otherwise null.
     */
    public User getUser(int userId) {
        return userRepository.findById(userId);
    }

    /**
     * Retrieves all active users.
     *
     * @return A list of active users.
     */
    public List<User> getAllActiveUsers() {
        return userRepository.findAll().stream()
                .filter(User::isActive)
                .toList();
    }

    /**
     * Creates a new user.
     *
     * @param userName The name of the new user.
     * @return The newly created User object, or null if creation failed.
     */
    public User createUser(String userName) {
        if (getAllActiveUsers().size() < MAX_USERS) {
            User newUser = new User(userName, true);
            return userRepository.save(newUser);
        } else {
            System.err.println("Maximum number of users reached.");
            return null;
        }
    }
}
By following these conventions and practices, you'll contribute to a codebase that is easier to understand, collaborate on, and maintain over time. If you have any questions about these guidelines, please don't hesitate to ask.
